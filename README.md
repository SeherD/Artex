This is your instruction guide to experiencing the best features of Artex.
After downloading this zip, you must run the solution.
The first page that you will encounter will be the Landing Page.
Here you have two options:
You can Login using the credentials Username: 123 and Password: 123.
If you would like to sign up for an account, you should choose the Artist Account since the Viewer Account is outside the scope of this project.
To sign up with an Artist Account use the following credentials Username: Artist1 and Password: 45678. The rest of the fields can be filled in however you want.
On successful sign up, you will be taken to the Login page where you can login with the credentials you signed up with: Username: Artist1 and Password: 45678.
On successful login, you have now reached the main application:

The first page is the Library:

First feature to try : Search Title
The search is case sensitive but fully functional, so you can try different phrases and image titles and look at the results. A few sample searches :
Five will give you two images called Five Star and Five Eyes.

D will give you Dawn, Dusk and Darkness, you can further narrow it down by Da or Daw or Du to get any of the specific images

Next feature to try : Tags
Try any of the checkboxes to see a collection of images pop up that fulfill that tag.
If you try two tags together eg. #pencilshading and #watercolors you will get the union of those two collections.

Next feature to try : Upload Image
On clicking upload image a pseudo-File Browser will open with three images, you should Ctrl+Click all three and click Add to Library.
You will be sent back to the Library, where if you scroll down, you can see that all three of the images have been added.

Next feature to try : Edit Image
Once you have uploaded the three images, you should double click on the one labelled magritte
This will take you to a new window, where you should see the image and have the option to change the title, add a new tag and assign a tag to the image.
You can change the title to whatever you would like, add a new tag of your choice (do click confirm tag) and then assign a tag to the image.
Once you save your changes, you should see those changes reflected on that image in the library.

Next feature to try : Add to Shop
When you click Add to Shop, a box is visible at the bottom of the screen.
You must Ctrl+Click on however many images you would like to add to shop and then drag them to the box. If you are happy with your selection, you should click confirm else click cancel.
Since the Add to Shop is not actually tied into the Edit Shop page, your changes will not be reflected on that page.

Next feature to try : Add a new folder
Click on Add New Folder and put in a folder name of your choice, if you're happy with the name, press Save Folder Name, else press cancel. 
If you confirmed, you now have a new folder, you can click on it and it will be empty.
If you click on the Watercolors and OilPaintings folders you can see that they have a different collection of images than Default.

Last feature in the Library: Drag and Drop to move multiple images
You can select multiple images using Ctrl+click and drag them to the name of a folder, after which they will disappear from the Default folder view. Unfortunately, this fucntionality isn't tied in on the other end and you cannot see these changes reflected if you click on the folder you dropped the images into.
